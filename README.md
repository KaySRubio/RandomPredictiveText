  <h2>Challenge:</h2>
  		<p>Code a program that analyzes a text file and produces new text randomly but in the style of the original text.</p>
  <h2>Solution:</h2>
  			<p>I coded a program that uses a two-dimensional linked list structure to generate Markov models from a text file.</p>
  			<br>
  			<p>To generate text that is random but in the style of the original text, the program randomly chooses a word, then randomly chooses another word that follows that word anywhere in the text.  Words that more frequently follow the first are more likely to be chosen.  Then, the program chooses another word that follows the second word, and so on.</p>

    <h2>How to run on your computer</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have java machine installed so you can compile the program</li>
        <li>Download the 3 .java files and save them in the same folder</li>
        <li>Compile them (you can compile Project2.java and this should compile the others)</li>
        <li>Save a text file in the same folder as Project2.java</li>
        <li>Run Project2 and answer the prompts. Include the name of the text file.</li>
        <li>Although the project can run in orders higher than 3, I suggest using orders 1-3 since order 4+ may be too similar to the original text</li>
        <li>Have fun!</li>
